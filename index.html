        <p class="text">"Imagine you met a man who told you that his annual income was one million dollars a year. Would you not be impressed by his wealth?
            I believe that most of us certainly would. What if that man then revealed that his annual expenses were $975,000 a year? Would you still
            be impressed by his wealth? Probably much less so. When it comes to accruing wealth, the amount of money coming in is not nearly as important
            as the amount you retain. EXACTLY THE SAME IS TRUE OF KNOWLEDGE. so often I see students chasing after knowledge. This is a good and desirable trait.
            Never forget however, that important issue is not how much knowledge you learn - BUT HOW MUCH YOU RETAIN - for it is only the knowledge you can access
            and remember that will prove useful to you in future action. It is critical therefore, THAT YOUR ATTEMPTS AT GAINING KNOWLEDGE FOCUS AS MUCH ON KNOWLEDGE
             RETENTION AS THEY DO ON KNOWLEDGE ACQUISITION."

        <p>- excerpt from an <a class="hover" href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BN-T3NYBlji" target="_blank">instagram post</a> by John Danaher,
             a Brazilian jiu-jitsu coach
        </p>
        <p>When it comes to retaining coding knowledge, Anki is the most effective tool I've come across. I first learned about using Anki for memorizing syntax,
            patterns, and hacks in an article by Jack Kinsala. Then shortly thereafter, I independently came across an article
            by Derek Sivers in which he explains his approach to momorizing code. He does a great job at introducing Anki to
            beginners that it's best you hear if from him: <a class="hover" href="https://sivers.org/srs" target="_blank">https://sivers.org/srs</a>.
            If you like Derek's article then also check
             out <a class="hover" href="https://www.jackkinsella.ie/articles/janki-method" target="_blank">Jack Kinsalla's article</a> as well (note: the original version of the article is better than the updated one).
        </p>
        <p>
            I can't recommend Anki enough. It's a shame that the software has a counterintuitive interface that turns some beginners away, 
            but if you commit to it, I'm convinced you'll see a significant noticeable improvement in your coding skill. I ascribe my success at technical interviews to Anki.
             If you do this right, you too won't need to specifically prepare for technical interviews.
